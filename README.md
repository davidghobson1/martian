If a martian came down to Earth today, they'd need some kind of tool to analyze and make sense of our complex language. This library automates many of the tedious text data mining and natural language processing (NLP) tasks, so you can focus on building great solutions. 
By abstracting many of the popular NLP libraries into a familiar and easy-to-use Python API, you can greatly simplify text analytics workflows.

## Features

This library contains classes and methods to perform several routine NLP techniques. The result is fewer lines of code, faster development, and overall, a text analysis workflow that's *out of this world*. Some of the features include:
- translation (through the Azure API; in *translation* sub-package)
- tokenization & lemmatization (`text_processing.py`)
- identifying noun phrases (`text_processing.py`)
- parts-of-speech tagging (`text_processing.py`)
- tweet processing (`tweet_processing.py`)
- calculating frequency distributions (*pandas_frequency_distribution* sub-package)
- generating word embeddings (*word_embeddings* sub-package)
- basic text summarization (*text_summarization* sub-package)
- plotting & visualization (`plotting_helper.py`)
